# JS-CMS
JavaScript-based content management system.

A simple\* CMS based on JavaScript. No PHP, no server-side.

The news content can be modified by editing the /etc/news.js file.

Consider this a website template. It's useful when you have to create a website with dynamic content, but you don't want to install any of those over-complicated CMS.

\* Note: For geeks.
