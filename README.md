# JS-CMS
JavaScript-based content management system.

A simple\* CMS based on JavaScript. No PHP, no server-side.

The news content can be modified by editing the /etc/news.js file.

Consider this a website template. It's useful when you have to create a website with dynamic content, but you don't want to install any of those over-complicated CMS's.

Special feature (it's actually a bug, but it can be seen as a special feature, *therefore it's a special feature*): content from news.js is **not** indexed by Google (due to ID being specified using the fragment identifier)

\* Note: For geeks.
